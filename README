Encoding Service Benchmark

Measures performance of encoding services by submitting a test job or jobs and 
capturing relevant metrics. This test suite supports a subset of common 
capabilities across multiple encoding services. It is not designed to enable 
every possible encoding scenario, rather, a set of common encoding options.


RUNTIME PARAMETERS
* audio_bitrate         Desired audio bitrate (kbps) - if not specified, 
                        encoding service will select an appropriate rate based
                        on the input file and other settings
* bframes               [0-16] Maximum number of consecutive B-frames for h.264
                        encoding (not applicable to other output formats). 
                        Values above 5 or 6 rarely provide much benefit. 
                        Default is 2
* cleanup               [0|1] whether or not to cleanup output files generated
                        during testing. Default is 1. If set to 0, output files
                        will remain in the same storage container as the input
                        file(s) with a prefix 'ch[random number]'
* concurrent_requests   The max number of concurrent API requests to allow 
                        during testing. This is only applicable to tests
                        involving multiple input files (thus multiple 
                        concurrent jobs). When jobs are pending, the test 
                        agent will make concurrent API requests for job 
                        status until all jobs are complete. Default is 8. Max 
                        is 32
* debug                 [0|1] Enable verbose logging? (default 0)
* format                Desired output format, one of the following:
                          aac =>  aac audio codec (audio default)
                          mp4 =>  h.264 video / aac audio codec (video default)
                          ogg =>  theora video and vorbis audio codec
                          webm => vp8 video and vorbis audio codec
                        File extensions used for output files are the same as
                        the format designation
* frame_rate            Optional frame rate for output - if not specified, 
                        original frame rate will be assumed
* hls                   For 'mp4' format jobs where the desired output is an 
                        HLS compatible playlist. For details on recommended HLS
                        settings, see 
                        https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2224/_index.html
                        This option supports the following HLS output formats:
                        
BIT  16:9 Res  4:3 Res   Profile        Video Kbps  Audio Kbps  Keyframes  Frame Rate
1    NA        NA        NA             NA          64          NA         NA
2    400x225   400x300   Baseline, 3.0  200         64          36         12
4    480x270   480x360   Baseline, 3.0  400         64          45         15
8    640x360   640x480   Baseline, 3.0  600         64          90         29.97
16   960x540   960x720   Main, 3.1      1800        64          90         29.97
32   1024x576  1024x768  Main, 3.1      2000        64          90         29.97
64   1280x720  1280x960  Main, 3.1      4500        64          90         29.97
                        
                        To use this setting - simply add up the BIT value for 
                        each desired output format. For example, to enable all 
                        formats: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127. Use of this 
                        parameter overrides the audio_bitrate, audio_only, 
                        frame_rate, format (mp4), keyframe, profile, two_pass 
                        (hls encoding is always one pass) and video_bitrate 
                        parameters
* hls_segment           Segment size (seconds) for HLS output - default 10
* input                 [REQUIRED] Name of the input file object(s) in 
                        'storage_container'. Either a single file or a file 
                        pattern (e.g. myvideo.mp4; *video*.mp4)
* input_downloaders     If the encoding service supports concurrent downloading
                        of input files, this parameter may define the number of
                        concurrent processes. Default 5
* input_min_segment     If the encoding service supports concurrent downloading
                        of input files, this parameter may define the minimum 
                        download segment size for workers. Size quantifiers 
                        supported: B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes)
                        GB (gigabytes). Default is 8MB
* keyframe              Number of keyframes per second - default 250
* max_api_requests_sec  Max number of API requests allowed per second. Test 
                        harness will introduce sleep intervals when necessary 
                        to avoid exceeding this limit
* profile               Desired h.264 profile (for 'mp4' format jobs only).

                        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Profiles
* reference_frames      [0-16] Number of reference frames to use for h.264
                        encoding (not applicable to other output formats). 
                        Default is 3

                        written to
* storage_key           [REQUIRED] API key for the storage_container. These 
                        credentials are necessary for the test agent to inspect
                        encoding input and output files and for the encoding

                        on the input file and other settings
* width                 Desired video resolution width (height will be adjusted

                        will be maintained. May be necessary in order to 
                        accommodate designated video_bitrate

time                    Total job time (stop - start). time* metrics are 
                        recorded by the test agent using job polling. These 
                        are independent of the comparable metrics reported by 
                        the encoding service (e.g. job_start, job_stop, 
                        job_time)

time_queue              Time the job spent in queue state (secs)
time_upload             Time to upload the transcoded files (secs)


Those result metrics listed as optional may or may not be provided depending
on the encoding service capabilities for providing such stats.

If test results in multiple jobs (e.g. input parameter results in multiple 
files), the preceeding metric names will utilize incrementing numeric suffixes 
(e.g. time1, time2).
