Encoding Service Benchmark

Measures performance of encoding services by submitting a test job or jobs and 
capturing relevant metrics. This test suite supports a subset of common 
capabilities across multiple encoding services. It is not designed to enable 
every possible encoding scenario, rather, a set of common encoding options.


RUNTIME PARAMETERS
* audio_bitrate         Desired audio bitrate (kbps) - default is 64
* bframes               [0-16] Maximum number of consecutive B-frames for h.264
                        encoding (not applicable to other output formats). 
                        Values above 5 or 6 rarely provide much benefit. 
                        Default is 3
* cleanup               [0|1] whether or not to cleanup output files generated
                        during testing. Default is 1. If set to 0, output files
                        will remain in the same storage container as the input
                        file(s) with a prefix 'ch[random number]'
* concurrent_requests   The max number of concurrent API requests to allow 
                        during testing. This is only applicable to tests
                        involving multiple input files (thus multiple 
                        concurrent jobs). When jobs are pending, the test 
                        agent will make concurrent API requests for job 
                        status until all jobs are complete. Default is 8. Max 
                        is 32
* debug                 [0|1] Enable verbose logging? (default 0)
* format                Desired output format, one of the following:
                          aac =>  aac audio codec (audio default)
                          mp4 =>  h.264 video / aac audio codec (video default)
                          ogg =>  theora video and vorbis audio codec
                          webm => vp8 video and vorbis audio codec
                        File extensions used for output files are the same as
                        the format designation
* frame_rate            Optional frame rate for output - if not specified, 
                        original frame rate will be assumed
* hls                   For 'mp4' format jobs where the desired output is an 
                        HLS compatible playlist. For details on recommended HLS
                        settings, see 
                        https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2224/_index.html
                        This option supports the following HLS output formats:
                        
                        BIT  16:9 Res  4:3 Res   Profile        Video Bitrate   Audio Bitrate  Keyframes  Frame Rate
                        1    NA        NA        NA             NA (audio only) 64             NA         NA
                        2    400x225   400x300   Baseline, 3.0  200             64             45         15
                        4    480x270   480x360   Baseline, 3.0  400             96             90         29.97
                        8    640x360   640x480   Baseline, 3.0  600             128            120        29.97
                        16   960x540   960x720   Main, 3.1      1800            128            240        29.97
                        32   1024x576  1024x768  Main, 3.1      2000            128            300        29.97
                        64   1280x720  1280x960  Main, 3.1      4500            128            300        29.97
                        
                        To use this setting - simply add up the BIT value for 
                        each desired output format. For example, to enable all 
                        formats: 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127. Use of this 
                        parameter overrides the audio_bitrate, audio_only, 
                        frame_rate, format (mp4), keyframe, profile, two_pass 
                        (false) and video_bitrate parameters
* hls_segment           Segment size (seconds) for HLS output - default 10
* input                 [REQUIRED] Name of the input file object(s) in 
                        'storage_container'. Either a single file or a file 
                        pattern (e.g. myvideo.mp4; *video*.mp4)
* input_downloaders     If the encoding service supports concurrent downloading
                        of input files, this parameter may define the number of
                        concurrent processes. Default 5
* input_min_segment     If the encoding service supports concurrent downloading
                        of input files, this parameter may define the minimum 
                        download segment size for workers. Size quantifiers 
                        supported: B (bytes), KB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes)
                        GB (gigabytes). Default is 8MB
* keyframe              Number of keyframes per second - default 300
* profile               Desired h.264 profile (for 'mp4' format jobs only).
