Implements necessary functionality for encoding testing against the zencoder
platform.

== API Specific Runtime Parameters ==
* service_param1        Optional nickname of the credentials zencoder should
                        use to interact with the storage_container. These must
                        be saved in https://app.zencoder.com/account/credentials
                        If not set, runtime credential parameters will be used.
                        Set this parameter to '1' to use default credentials
* service_param2        If set to 1, jobs will be started using integration
                        mode. Encoding will be shortened to 5 seconds and job 
                        will not be charged
* service_param3        If set to 1, zencoder 'strict' mode will be enabled 
                        signifying that encoding settings problems will not be 
                        automatically corrected. For more details, see 
                        https://app.zencoder.com/docs/api/encoding/general-output-settings/strict
