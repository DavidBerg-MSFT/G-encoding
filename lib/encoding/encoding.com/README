Implements necessary functionality for encoding testing against the 
encoding.com platform.

WebM Notes:
Single pass WebM encoding does not seem to work. During testing, we discovered
such outputs were missing audio and had very grainy and distorted video. 
encoding.com recommended switching to two-pass using preset 1 for better 
quality, and this does in indeed fix the problem. Using two_pass=0 will result
in preset=6 and two_pass=1 will use preset=1.


== API Specific Runtime Parameters ==
* service_param1        [1|0] Set to 1 to enable encoding.com's 'multithread'
                        feature. This improves transfer speed between S3 and 
                        encoding.com servers through use of multithreading and
                        range requests. By default this is enabled. Set to 0 to
                        disable. For more information see 
                        http://www.encoding.com/help/article/optimized_s3_transport
* service_param2        [1|0] Set to 1 to enable encoding.com's 'nocopy' 
                        feature. This inhibits copying of media from your S3
                        bucket to encoding.com (media transferred directly from
                        S3 to encoding.com servers). In order to use this 
                        feature the media must exist in S3 and should exist in 
                        the same region. By default this will be enabled if 
                        these conditions are met. For more information see

* service_param3        [turbo|twin_turbo] Enable encoding.com's faster 'turbo'
                        or 'twin_turbo' mode. For more information see
                        http://www.encoding.com/turbo_encoding_explained
